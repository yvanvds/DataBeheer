# Extension exercises

The previous exercises introduced you to the basics of writing content for your TeachBook, as well as getting started with the syntax used. Now letâ€™s explore how you can add functionalities to your book using extensions. TeachBooks created a variety of Sphinx extensions to enhance your book: see [the manual](https://teachbooks.io/manual/features/overview.html) for a complete overview, including [TeachBooks Favourites](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites) which collects a collection of our favourite Sphinx extensions. The TeachBooks Favourites collection is already included in this template. Furthermore, you can also install third-party extensions to further customize your content.
